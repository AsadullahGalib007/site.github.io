          <p>I am a lazy person, which is why I like open source, for other people to do work for me. Software is like sex: it's better when it's free. In short: just say NO TO DRUGS, and maybe you won't end up like the Hurd people. A computer is like air conditioning - it becomes useless when you open Windows</p>

            <p>Hackers "like confusing people who are stuffier and less mentally agile than we are, especially when they're bosses. There's a little bit of the mad scientist in all hackers, ready to discombobulate the world and flip authority the finger â€” especially if we can do it with snazzy special effects."</p>

            <p>Empowerment of individuals is a key part of what makes open source work, since in the end, innovations tend to come from small groups, not from large, structured efforts. Create more value than you capture. The future is always scary to those who cling to the past.</p>
